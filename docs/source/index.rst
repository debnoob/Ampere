   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

impedance.py
=============

:code:`impedance.py` is a Python module for working with impedance data.

This project started at the `2018 Electrochemical Society (ECS) Hack Week
<https://www.electrochem.org/233/hack-week/>`_ in Seattle and has grown from there.

Using a `scikit-learn-like API <https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.0238>`_,
we hope to make visualizing, fitting, and analyzing impedance spectra
more intuitive and reproducible.

.. note::
  :code:`impedance.py` is currently in the alpha phase and new features are rapidly being added and changed.

If you have a feature request or find a bug, please feel free to
`file an issue <https://github.com/ECSHackWeek/impedance.py/issues>`_ or,
better yet, make the code improvements and submit a `pull request
<https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/>`_!
The goal is to build an open-source tool that the entire impedance
community can improve and use!

The easiest way to install the package is using pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install impedance


.. toctree::
